# Pathogen-Host Interaction Phenotype Ontology

PHIPO is a formal ontology of species-neutral phenotypes observed in pathogen-host interactions.

PHIPO is being developed to support the comprehensive and detailed representation of phenotypes in PHI-base, the multi-species Pathogen-Host Interactions database available online at http://www.phi-base.org. PHIPO is pre-composed and logically defined.

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

* http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/phipo.owl
* http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/phipo.obo

### Editors' version

Editors of this ontology should use the edit version, [src/ontology/phipo-edit.owl](src/ontology/phipo-edit.owl)
