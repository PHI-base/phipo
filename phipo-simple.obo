comment: Note that colony morphology terms are not used in PHIPO to annotate filamentous-form colonies because these phenotypes can be related to specific growth terms for hyphal colony morphology please search for PHIPO:0001214 (hyphal growth phenotype). For unicellular colony morphology at the usual resolution it is usually not possible to make any statement about an individual. For dimorphic pathogens these terms are suitable for yeast-form colony phenotypes.

def: "a relation between a specifically dependent continuant (the dependent) and an independent continuant (the bearer), in which the dependent specifically depends on the bearer for its existence" []
comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.
